<p>We continue our little introduction by looking at <em>data sets</em> in the sense of a list of values that we want to describe closer.</p>
<p>We use the <code>mieten3.asc</code> from <a href="https://data.ub.uni-muenchen.de/2/">Open Data LMU</a>. The data set contains information about rents in Munich from the year 2003. The columns have the following meaning, see <code>DETAILS</code>:</p>

<p>First we are looking at the total net rent, i.e.&nbsp;the row <code>nm</code>.</p>
<p>For a vector <span class="math inline">\(v \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>the maximal value, i.e.&nbsp;the maximum <span class="math display">\[

<p>From this Python snippet we know that for tenants the rent varied between 77.31 and 1789.55, with an average of 570.09 and a median of 534.3. Of course there are tricky questions that require us to dig a bit deeper into these functions, e.g.&nbsp;how many rooms does the most expensive flat have? The surprising answer is 3 and it was built in 1994, but how do we obtain these results?</p>
<p>We can use <code>numpy.argwhere</code> or a function which returns the index directly like <code>numpy.argmax</code>.</p>

<p>The plot contains the box which is defined by the 1st quantile <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span> and the 3rd quantile <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span>, with the median as line in between these two. Furthermore, we can see the whiskers which help us identify so called outliers. By default they are defined as <span class="math inline">\(\pm 1.5(Q_3 - Q_1)\)</span>, where (<span class="math inline">\(Q_3 - Q_1\)</span>) is often called the <em>interquartile range</em> (IQR).</p>

Figure&nbsp;2.5: Scatterplot to investigate correlations in the data set.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the first plot of <a href="#fig-correlation" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>2.5</span></a> we see that the rent tends to go up with the size of the flat but there are for sure some rather cheap options in terms of space.</p>
<p>The second plot of <a href="#fig-correlation" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>2.5</span></a> tells us that central heating became a constant around <span class="math inline">\(1966\)</span>. Of course we can also guess that the older buildings with central heating were renovated, but we have no data to support this claim.</p>
<p>The third plot of <a href="#fig-correlation" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>2.5</span></a> does not yield an immediate correlation.</p>
<p>More formally, we can describe possible correlations using the <em>covariance</em>. The covariance is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables.</p>

<p>The covariance is tricky to interpret, e.g.&nbsp;the unities of the two must not make sense. In the example below, we have rent per square meter, which makes some sense.</p>
