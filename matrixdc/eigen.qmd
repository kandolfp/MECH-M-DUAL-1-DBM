# Eigendecomposition {#sec-matrixdc-eigen}

We start off with the so called _eigendecomposition_.
The main idea is to compute a decomposition (or factorization) of a square matrix into a canonical form.
We will represent a matrix by its _eigenvalues_ and _eigenvectors_.
In order to do so we need to recall some more definitions from our favourite linear algebra book, such as @GoluLoan.

## Determinant

If $A = (a) \in \mathbb{R}^{1\times1}$ (a single number), then its _determinant_ is given by $\det(A) = a$. Now, the determinant of $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is defined in terms of order-$(n-1)$ determinants:
$$
\det(A) = \sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^{j+1} a_{1j}\det(A_1j),
$$
where $A_1j$ is a $(n-1) \times (n-1)$ matrix obtained by deleting the first row and the $j$th column of $A$.

[Compare @GoluLoan, pp. 66-67]
::::
:::

Some important properties of the determinant are:

1. for two matrices $A$ and $B$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$
$$
\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B),
$$
1. for the transpose $A^T$ of a matrix $A$
$$
\det(A^T) = \det(A),
$$
1. for a scalar $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ and a matrix $A$
$$
\det(\alpha A) = \alpha^n\det(A),
$$
1. we call a matrix $A$ _nonsingular_ (i.e. invertible) if and only if
$$
\det(A) \not= 0,
$$
1. for an invertible matrix $A^{-1}$
$$
\det\left(A^{-1}\right) = \frac{1}{\det(A)},
$$

So let us check in `numpy`:
```{python}
#| classes: styled-output
#| error: true
import numpy as np
from numpy import linalg as LA

A = np.array([[2, 0, 0],
              [0, 3, 4],
              [0, 4, 9]])
det_A = LA.det(A)
print(f"{det_A=}")

A_T = np.transpose(A)
det_A_T = LA.det(A_T)
print(f"{det_A_T=}")

X = LA.inv(A)
det_X = LA.det(X)
print(f"{det_X=}")

print(f"{det_X*det_A=}")

det_Am = LA.det(-A)
print(f"{det_Am=}")
```

::: {.callout appearance="simple"}
:::: {#def-eigenvalues} 
## Eigenvalues
For a matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$ the _eigenvalues_ are the roots of the _characteristic polynomial_ 
$$
p(\lambda) = \det(A - \lambda I).
$$
Consequently, every $n\times n$ matrix has exactly $n$ eigenvalues. Note that for a real matrix the eigenvalues might still be in $\mathbb{C}$.

The set of all eigenvalues of $A$ is denoted by
$$
\lambda(A) = \left\{\lambda : \det(A-\lambda I)=0\right\}.
$$
If all of the eigenvalues are real (in $\mathbb{R}$) we can sort them from largest to smallest
$$
\lambda_n(A) \leq \cdots \leq \lambda_2(A) \leq \lambda_1(A),
$$
and we denote the largest by $\lambda_{max}(A) = \lambda_1(A)$ and the smallest by $\lambda_{min}(A) = \lambda_n(A)$, respectively.

From the above properties of the determinant we can conclude that, if $X \in \mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$ is nonsingular and $B = X^{-1} A X$, then $A$ and $B$ are called _similar_ and two similar matrices have exactly the same eigenvalues.

```{python}
#| classes: styled-output
#| error: true
lam = LA.eigvals(A)
lam_sort = np.sort(lam)

print(f"{lam_sort=}")
```

::: {.callout appearance="simple"}
:::: {#def-eigenvector} 
## Eigenvector
If $\lambda \in \lambda(A)$, then there exists a nonzero vector $v$ so that 
$$
Av = \lambda v \iff (A - \lambda I)v = 0.
$$ {#eq-eigenvector}
Such a vector is called _eigenvector_ of $A$ associated with $\lambda$.

## Eigendecomposition
If $A \in \mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$ has $n$ (linear) independent eigenvectors $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ and $Av_i=\lambda_i v_i$, for $i=1:n$, than $A$ is _diagonalizable_. 

If we combine the eigenvectors to a matrix
$$
V = \left[v_1 | \cdots | v_n\right],
$$
then
$$
V^{-1} A V = \operatorname{diag}(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n) = \Lambda = \left[
    \begin{array}{cccc} \lambda_1 & 0 & \dots & 0\\
                        0 & \lambda_2 & \ddots & \vdots \\  
                        \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & 0\\
                        0 & \dots & 0 & \lambda_n \\  \end{array}
\right].
$$
This is called the _eigendecomposition_ of the matrix $A$.

[Compare @GoluLoan, pp. 66-67]
::::
:::

Not all matrices $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ are diagonalizable.

```{python}
#| classes: styled-output
#| error: true
lam, V = LA.eig(A)
A_eigen = np.diag(lam)
print(f"{A_eigen=}")
print(f"{V=}")

v_1 = (A @ V[:, 0]) / lam[0]
print(f"{v_1=}")

A_eigen2 = LA.inv(V) @ A @ V
print(f"{A_eigen2=}")

print(f"{np.allclose(A_eigen, A_eigen2)=}")
```

We can use what we have learned about the basis of a vector space and the transformation between two bases, see @sec-intro-linearalgebra-basis to get a different interpretation of the eigendecomposition.

We recall, if $x$ is represented in the standard basis with matrix $I$ we can change to the basis represented by $V$ and therefore $\hat{x} = V^{-1}x$.

Consequently, the equation
$$
A = V \Lambda V^{-1} 
$$
means that in the basis created by $V$ the matrix $A$ is represented by a diagonal matrix.

## Examples for the application

To get a better idea what the eigendecomposition can do we look into some examples.

### Solving system of linear equations

For a system of linear equations $Ax=b$ we get
$$
\begin{array}{lll}
A x & = b  & \iff \\
V \Lambda V^{-1} x & = b  & \iff \\
\Lambda V^{-1} x & = V^{-1} b  & \iff \\
V^{-1} x & = \Lambda^{-1}V^{-1} b  & \iff \\
x & = V\Lambda^{-1}V^{-1} b  & \iff
\end{array}
$$
As $\Lambda^{-1} = \operatorname{diag}\left(\lambda_1^{-1}, \ldots, \lambda_n^{-1}\right)$ this is easy to compute once we have the eigenvalue decomposition.

::: {.callout-note}
The computation of the eigendecomposition is not cheap, therefore this is not always worth the effort and there are other ways of solving linear systems.
:::

### Linear Ordinary Differential Equations

In this example we use the eigendecomposition to efficiently solve a system of differential equations
$$
\dot{x} = A x,\quad x(0) = x_0
$$
By changing to the basis $V$ and using the notation $\hat{x}=z$ we have the equivalent formulations
$$
z = V^{-1}x \iff x = Vz,
$$
and if follows
$$
\begin{array}{lll}
\dot{x} = A x & \iff V \dot{z} &= A V z \\
              & \iff \dot{z} &= V^{-1} A V z \\
              & \iff \dot{z} &= \Lambda z
\end{array}.
$$
So for an initial value $z_0$ the solution in $t$ is
$$
z(t) = \operatorname{diag}\left(e^{t\lambda_1}, \ldots, e^{t\lambda_n}\right) z_0.
$$

We often say that it is now a _decoupled_ differential equation.

### Higher Order Linear Differential Equations

If we have a higher order linear ODE such as
$$
x^{(n)} + a_{n-1} x^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_2 \ddot{x} + a_1 \dot{x} + a_0 x = 0.
$$ {#eq-hoode}
we can stack the derivatives into a vector
$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
x_1 & = & x\\
x_2 & = & \dot{x}\\
x_3 & = & \ddot{x}\\
\vdots & = & \vdots \\
x_{n-1} & = & x^{(n-2)} \\
x_{n} & = & x^{(n-1)} \\
\end{array}
\quad
\Leftrightarrow
\quad
\left[
    \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ \vdots \\ x_{n-1} \\ x_n \end{array}
\right]
=
\left[
    \begin{array}{c} x \\ \dot{x} \\ \ddot{x} \\ \vdots \\ x^{(n-2)} \\ x^{(n-1)} \end{array}
\right],
$$
and taking the derivative of this vector yields the following system
$$
\underbrace{
\frac{d}{d t}
\left[
    \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ \vdots \\ x_{n-1} \\ x_n \end{array}
\right]
}_{\dot{x}}
=
\underbrace{\left[
    \begin{array}{cccccc} 0 & 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0\\
                          0 & 0 & 1 & \dots & 0 & 0\\  
                          0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0\\
                          \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots\\
                          0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 1\\
                          -a_0 & -a_1 & -a_2 & \dots & -a_{n-2} & -a_{n-1}\\
    \end{array}
\right]
}_{A}
\underbrace{
\left[
    \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ \vdots \\ x_{n-1} \\ x_n \end{array}
\right]
}_x.
$$

We transformed it into a system of coupled 1st order ODEs $\dot{x}=Ax$ and we can solve this as seen above.
More importantly, the characteristic polynomial of @eq-hoode is equal to the characteristic polynomial of @def-eigenvalues and the eigenvalues are the roots of this polynomial.

### Generalized eigenvalue problem

Let us motivate this by the example of _modal analysis_.
If we consider the free vibrations of a undamped system we get the equation
$$
M\ddot{u} + K u = 0, \quad u(0) = u_0,
$$
with the mass matrix $M$ and the stiffness matrix $K$ and $u(t)$ being the displacement.
As we know, the solution of this linear differential equation has the form $u(t)=e^{i\omega t}u_0$ and thus we get
$$
(-\omega^2 M + K) u_0 = 0.
$$ {#eq-ma}

::: {.callout appearance="simple"}
:::: {#def-edc} 
## Generalized eigenvalue problem
If $A, B \in \mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$, then the set of all matrices of the form $A-\lambda B$ with $\lambda\in\mathbb{C}$ is a _pencil_. The _generalized eigenvalues_ of $A-\lambda B$ are elements of the set $\lambda(A,B)$ defined by
$$
\lambda(A,B) = \{z\in\mathbb{C}: \det(A-zB)=0\}.
$$
If $\lambda \in \lambda(A,B)$ and $0\neq v\in\mathbb{C}^n$ satisfies
$$
A v = \lambda B v,
$$ {#eq-gevp}
then $v$ is an _eigenvector_ of $A-\lambda B$.
The problem of finding a nontrivial solution to @eq-gevp is called the _generalized eigenvalue problem_.

[Compare @GoluLoan, chap. 7.7]
::::
:::

In our example @eq-ma the eigenvalues are $\lambda = \omega^2$ and correspond to the square of the natural frequencies and the eigenvectors $v=u$ correspond to the modes of vibration.

If $M$ is invertible we can write 
$$
M^{-1}(K -\omega^2 M ) u_0 = (M^{-1}K -\omega^2 I ) u_0 = 0.
$$

::: {.callout-warning}
In most cases inverting the matrix is not recommended, to directly solve the generalized eigenvalue problem, see [@GoluLoan, chap. 7.7] for details. 
:::

Let us walk through this with an example from [@Downey2024VibrationMechanicsPractical, Sec. 8.3].

## Two Story Building

![Two story frame where the floors have different dynamic properties.](../_assets/matrixdc/TwoStoryBuilding.svg){#fig-twostorybuilding}

In @fig-twostorybuilding we can see a two story building consisting of a two column frame with a floor.
The first floor columns are fixed at the base and have a height $h$, the second floor is fixed to the first and has the same height.
The columns of each frame are modelled as beams with flexural rigidity $EI$ and $2 EI$, respectively
Where $E$ is called _Young's modulus_ and $I$ the _second moment of area_.
The mass is centred at the floor level.

This allows us to model such a building as a system with two degrees of freedom $x_1$ and $x_2$ as the displacement indicated in blue. The dashed blue line would be such a displacement for the frame. 

The resulting equations of motion become
$$
\begin{array}{r}
m_1 \ddot{x_1} + k_1 x_1 + k_2 (x_2 - x_1) = 0,\\
m_2 \ddot{x_1} + k_2 (x_2 - x_1) = 0,
\end{array}
$$
resulting in the matrices
$$
M = \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
m_1 & 0 \\
0 & m_2
\end{array}
\right], \quad
K = \left[\begin{array}{cc}
k_1 + k_2 & -k_2 \\
-k_2 & k_2
\end{array}
\right].
$$

For the derivation of the stiffness coefficients we refer to [@Downey2024VibrationMechanicsPractical, pp. 188] and recall the result here as follows
$$
k_1 = \frac{48 EI}{h^3}, \quad k_2 = \frac{24 EI}{h^3}.
$$
This results in the stiffness matrix
$$
K = \underbrace{\frac{24 EI}{h^3}}_{=k}
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
3 & -1 \\
-1 & 1
\end{array}
\right].
$$

Now we can manually compute 
$$
\det(-\omega^2 M + K) = 0 \Leftrightarrow 2m^2\omega^4 - 5 m k \omega^2 + 2 k^2 = 0,
$$
and solving this equation for $\omega^2$ results in 
$$
\omega_1^2 = \frac{k}{2m}, \quad \omega_2^2 = \frac{2k}{m}.
$$

To compute the eigenvectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ we use @eq-eigenvector, i.e. for $v_1$ this reads as
$$
-\frac{k}{2m} \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
2m & 0 \\
0 & m
\end{array}
\right] 
+ 
k \left[\begin{array}{cc}
3 & -1 \\
-1 & 1
\end{array}
\right]
\left[\begin{array}{c}
v_{11}\\
v_{21}
\end{array}
\right]
= 
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
2 k & -k \\
-k & \frac{k}{2}
\end{array}
\right]
\left[\begin{array}{c}
v_{11}\\
v_{21}
\end{array}
\right]
\overset{!}{=} 
\left[\begin{array}{c}
0\\
0
\end{array}
\right],
$$
and results in the relation $2v_{11} = v_{21}$.
We can select a solution as
$$
v_1 = \left[\begin{array}{c}
\frac12\\
1
\end{array}
\right].
$$
For $v_2$ we proceed similarly and derive a solution as: 
$$
v_2 = \left[\begin{array}{c}
-1\\
1
\end{array}
\right].
$$

The eigenvectors illustrate how the displacement functions and are not just some theoretical value.
The following figure visualizes the two modes.

Two wrap up the example our overall temporal response consists of the time invariant part defined by our eigenvectors $v_1$, and $v_2$, as well as the time dependent part with our eigenfrequencies $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ as well as the constants $A_1$, $A_2$, $\phi_1$, $\phi_2$ depending on the initial condition [see @Downey2024VibrationMechanicsPractical, Chapter 5].

### Low-rank approximation of a square matrix

We can use the eigenvalue decomposition to _approximate_ a square matrix.

Let us sort the eigenvalues in $\Lambda$ and let us call $U^T=V^{-1}$ then we can write
$$
A = V\Lambda U^T = \sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_i v_i u_i^T
$$
where $v_i$ and $u_i$ correspond to the rows of the matrices.
Now we can define the  _rank_ $r$ approximation of $A$ as
$$
A\approx A_r = V\Lambda U^T = \sum_{i=1}^r\lambda_i v_i u_i^T.
$$

To make this a bit easier to understand the following illustration is helpful:

This approximation can be used to reduce the storage demand of an image.

## Summary
The eigenvalue decomposition is an important tool but it has its limitations:

1. the matrices involved need to be square
1. eigenvalues might be complex, even if the problem at hand is real
1. we only get a diagonal matrix $\Lambda$ if all eigenvectors are linear independent
1. the computation of $V^{-1}$ is non-trivial unless $A$ is symmetric and $V$ becomes unitary ($V^{-1} = V^T$).

Therefore, we will look into a generalized decomposition called the _singular value decomposition_ in the next section.
