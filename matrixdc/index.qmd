# Matrix decompositions {.unnumbered}

There are a lot of different matrix decompositions and they can be used to fulfil several tasks.
We are going to look into the _eigendecomposition_ as well as the _singular value decomposition_.
Both of these can, for example, be used for picture compression and recognition.

For notation we are following again @GoluLoan, which has plenty more to offer than we cover in these notes.
