# Singular Value Decomposition {#sec-matrixdc-svd}
The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is an orthogonal matrix reduction.
In contrast to the previously discussed Eigendecomposition it can be applied to rectangular matrices.
As we will see the interpretation of the SVD can be linked to the eigendecomposition but first, lets provide a proper definition.

::: {.callout appearance="simple"}
:::: {#thm-svd} 
## Singular Value Decomposition

If $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ (a real $m \times n$ matrix), there exists orthogonal matrices
$$
U = \left[u_1 | \cdots | u_m \right] \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times m}
\quad
\text{and}
\quad
V = \left[v_1 | \cdots | v_n \right] \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}
$$
such that 
$$
U^{\mathsf{T}} A V = \Sigma = \operatorname{diag}(\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_p) \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}, \quad p=\min\{m, n\},
$$ {#eq-svd}
where $\sigma_1 \geq \sigma_2 \geq \ldots \sigma_p \geq 0$.

::: {.callout-note}
We call $\sigma_i$ a _singular value_ of $A$, the $u_i$ are called the _left singular vectors_ of $A$ and $v_i$ the _right singular vectors_ of $A$.
Furthermore, $\sigma_{max} (A)$ is the largest singular value of $A$ and $\sigma_{min} (A)$ is the smallest singular value of $A$.
:::

Instead of providing a concise proof (if you are interested see [@GoluLoan, p. 76]) we show a possible motivation of the definition.

If we compute the eigendecompositions of $AA^{\mathsf{T}}$ and $A^{\mathsf{T}}A$.
The two matrices have the same positive eigenvalues - the squares of the eigenvalues of $A$ and we get

$$
\begin{array}{lll} (A A^{\mathsf{T}})U &= & U(\Lambda\Lambda^{\mathsf{T}}),\\
                   (A^{\mathsf{T}} A)V &= & V(\Lambda^{\mathsf{T}}\Lambda).
                   \end{array}
$$
For $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ with $m>n$ we get
$$
\Lambda = \left[
    \begin{array}{c} \tilde{\Lambda}\\0\end{array}
\right]
$$
with the diagonal matrix $\tilde\Lambda\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ and
$$
\begin{array}{llclc} \Lambda\Lambda^{\mathsf{T}} & = & \left[
    \begin{array}{cc}\tilde{\Lambda}^2 & 0 \\0 & 0 \end{array}
\right]  & = & \left[
    \begin{array}{cc}\tilde{\Sigma} & 0 \\0 & 0 \end{array}
\right],  \\
        \Lambda^{\mathsf{T}}\Lambda & = & \tilde{\Lambda}^2 &= &\tilde{\Sigma}.
                   \end{array}
$$
If we expand the matrices with zeros to match the correct dimensions this corresponds to our singular value decomposition
$$
A = U \Sigma V^{\mathsf{T}}.
$$

::: {.callout-important}
The singular value decomposition always exists, is real and all singular vectors are positive.

Again, to visualize the composition it helps to better understand what is happening.

![Singular Value Decomposition](../_assets/matrixdc/SVD){#fig-svd width=3.67in}

In the case that $m\geq n$, we can save storage by reducing the matrices $U$ and $\Sigma$, to their counterpart $U_1$ and $\Sigma_1$ by removing the zeros.

## Thin SVD

If $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ for $m\geq n$, then
$$
A = \tilde{U} \tilde{\Sigma} V^{\mathsf{T}}
$$
where
$$
U_1 = U(:, 1:n) = \left[u_1 | \cdots | u_n \right] \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}
$$
and
$$
\tilde{\Sigma} = \Sigma(1:n, 1:n) = \operatorname{diag}(\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_n) \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}.

```

## Low rank approximation

Again, we can cut of the reconstruction at a certain point and create an approximation.
More formally this is defined in the next definition.

::: {.callout appearance="simple"}
:::: {#def-svdlowrank} 
## Low-Rank Approximation

If $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and has the SVD $A = U\Sigma V^{\mathsf{T}}$ than
$$
A_k = U(:, 1:k)\, \Sigma(1:k, 1:k)\, V^{\mathsf{T}}(1:k, :)
$$
is the _optimal_ low-rank approximation of $A$ with rank $k$.
This is often called the _truncated SVD_.

::: {.callout-note}
If we compare this to @fig-mci_headquater we can see that we get a much better result for smaller $r$.
Let us have a look why.
:::

As the matrices $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal, they also define a basis of the corresponding (sub) vector spaces.
As mentioned before, the SVD automatically selects these and they are optimal.

Consequently, the matrices $U$ and $V$ can be understood as reflecting patterns in the image.
We can think of the columns of $U$ and $V$ as the vertical respectively horizontal patterns of $A$.

We can illustrate this by looking at the _modes_ of our decomposition
$$
M_k = U(:, k) V^{\mathsf{T}}(k, :).

::: {.callout-note}
The big advantage here is, that the selection is optimal.
A disadvantage is that the need to store the basis separately and this increases the necessary storage.
We will see in later sections about _wavelets_ and _Fourier_ decomposition how a common basis can be used to reduce the storage by still keeping good reconstructive properties.
:::

## Principal Component Analysis {#sec-matrixdc-pca}

On of the most important applications of SVD is in the stable computation of the so called _principal component analysis_ (PCA). It is a common technique in data exploration, analysis, visualization, and preprocessing. 

The main idea of PCM is to transform the data in such a way that the main directions (principal components) capture the largest variation. In short we perform a change of the basis, see @def-changebasis.

Let us investigate this in terms of a (artificial) data set. 

::: {.callout-important} 
This example is adapted from [@Brunton2022, Example: Noisy Gaussian Data, pp. 25-27].
:::

We generate a noisy cloud (see @fig-pca_gauss) that consists of $10000$ points in 2D, generated from a normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance.
The data is than:

1. scaled by $2$ in the first direction and by $\frac12$ in second,
1. rotated by $\frac\pi3$
1. translation in the direction $\left[2\ 1\right]^{\mathsf{T}}$.

The resulting matrix $X$ is a long and skinny matrix with each measurement (or experiment) stacked next to each other.
This means, each column represents a new set, e.g. a time step, and each row corresponds to the same sensor.

::: {.callout-important}
The following code is a slight adaptation (for nicer presentation in these notes) of the [@Brunton2022, Code 1.4] also see [notebook on github](https://github.com/dynamicslab/databook_python/blob/master/CH01/CH01_SEC05_1_PCAGaussian.ipynb).

### Computation

For the computation we follow the outline given in [@Brunton2022, Chap. 1.5].
First we need to center our matrix $X$ according to the mean per feature, in our case per row. 
$$
\overline{x}_j = \frac1n \sum_{i=1}^n X_{ij}
$$
and our _mean matrix_ is the outer product with the one vector
$$
\overline{X} = \left[\begin{array}{c}1\\\vdots\\1\end{array}\right] \overline{x}
$$
which can be used to compute the centred matrix $B = X - \overline{X}$.

The PCA is the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix
$$
C = \frac{1}{n-1} B^{\mathsf{T}} B
$$ {#eq-pca_cov}

::: {.callout-note}
The normalization factor of $n-1$ in @eq-pca_cov an not $n$ is called _Bassel's correction_ and compensates for the bias in the estimation of the population variance.
:::

As $C$ is symmetric and positive semi-definite, therefore it has non-negative real eigenvalues and the matrix $V$ of the eigendecomposition satisfies $V^{-1} = V^{\mathsf{T}}$ (i.e. it is orthogonal @def-orthonormalmatrix).
The principal components are the eigenvectors and the eigenvalue are the variance along these components.

If we instead compute the SVD of $B = U\Sigma V^{\mathsf{T}}$ we get
$$
C = \frac{1}{n-1} B^{\mathsf{T}}B = \frac{1}{n-1} V \Sigma V^{\mathsf{T}} = \frac{1}{n-1} V (\Lambda^{\mathsf{T}}\Lambda) V^{\mathsf{T}}
$$
leading to a way of computing the principal components in a robust way as
$$
\lambda_k = \frac{\sigma_k^2}{n-1}.
$$

::: {.callout-tip}
If the sensor ranges of our matrix are very different in magnitude the correlation matrix is scaled by the _row wise standard deviation_ of $B$ similar as for the mean.
:::

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis

print(r"In our example we get our scaled ")
print(r"$\sigma_1=" + str(float(round(S[0],3))) + r"\approx 2$")
print(r"and $\sigma_2=" + str(float(round(S[1],3))) + r"\approx \frac12$.")
print(r"These results recover our given parameters very well.")
print(r"Additionally we can see that our rotation matrix is closely matched by $U$ (up to signs) from our SVD:")
print(r"""$$
R_{\frac\pi3} = \left[
\begin{array}{cc} """ + str(float(round(R[0, 0], 3))) + "&" + str(float(round(R[1, 0], 3))) + r"\\" + str(float(round(R[0, 1], 3))) + "&" + str(float(round(R[1, 1], 3))) + r"""\end{array}
\right], \quad U = \left[

$$""")
```

### Example Eigenfaces {#sec-matrixcd-svd-eigenfaces}

We combine SVD/PCA in a illustrative example called _eigenfaces_ as introduced in [@Brunton2022, Sec 1.6, pp. 28-34].

The idea is to apply the PCA techniques to a large set of faces to extract the dominate correlations between the images and create a _face basis_ that can be used to represent an image in these coordinates.
For example you can reconstruct a face in this space by projecting onto the eigen vectors or it can be used for face recognition as similar faces usually cluster under this projection.

The images are taken from the Yale Face Dataset B, in our case we use a [GitHub](https://github.com/frankhuettner/Data_Driven_Science_Julia_Demos/tree/main) that provides [Julia](https://julialang.org/) Pluto notebooks for Chapter 1 to 4 of @Brunton2022.

Our training set, so to speak, consists of the first 36 people in the dataset.
We compute the _average face_ and subtract it from our dataset to get our matrix $B$.
From here a SVD provides us with our basis $U$.
To test our basis we use individual 37 and a portion of the image of the MCI Headquarter (to see how well it performs on objects).
For this we use the projection
$$
\tilde{x} = U_r U_r^{\mathsf{T}} x.
$$
If we split this up, we first project onto our found patterns (encode) and than reconstruct from them (decode).

::: {.callout-note}
We can understand this as _encoding_ and _decoding_ our test image, which is the general setup of an _autoencoder_ (a topic for another lecture).

The correlation coefficients $x_r = U_r^{\mathsf{T}} x$ might reveal patterns for different $x$.
In the case of faces, we can use this for face recognition, i.e. if the coefficients of $x_r$ are in the same cluster as other images, they are probably from the same person.

## Further applications of the SVD

There are many more applications of the SVD but we want to highlight some regarding systems of linear equations,
$$
A x = b
$$ {#eq-leq}
where the matrix $A$, as well as the vector $b$ is known an $x$ is unknown.

Depending on the structure of $A$ and the specific $b$ we have no solution, a unique solution, or infinitely many solutions.
For now, we focus on the case where $A$ is rectangular and therefore we have either an 

- under-determined system $m\ll n$, so more unknowns than equations,
- over-determined system $m\gg n$, so more equations than unknowns.

For the second case (more equations than unknowns) we often switch to solving the optimization problem that minimizes
$$
\|Ax-b\|_2^2.
$$ {#eq-leastsquare}
This is called the _least square_ solution.
The least square solution will also minimize $\|Ax-b\|_2$. 
For an under-determined system we might seek the solution which minimizes $\|x\|_2$ called the _minimum norm_ solution.

If we us the SVD decomposition for $A = U \Sigma V^{\mathsf{T}}$ we can define the following

::: {.callout appearance="simple"}
:::: {#def-pinv} 
## Pseudo-inverse

We define the matrix $A^\dagger \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ by $A^\dagger = V\Sigma^\dagger U^{\mathsf{T}}$ where
$$
\Sigma^\dagger = \operatorname{diag}\left(\frac{1}{\sigma_1}. \frac{1}{\sigma_2}, \ldots, \frac{1}{\sigma_r}, 0, \ldots, 0\right) \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}, \quad r=\operatorname{rank}(A).
$$

The matrix $A^\dagger$ is often called the _Moore-Penrose left pseudo-inverse_ as it fulfils the [_Moore-Penrose conditions_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%E2%80%93Penrose_inverse) conditions.
It is also the matrix that attains the minimal Frobenius norm solution to 
$$
\min_{X \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}}\| A X - I_n\|_F.
$$

If we only use the truncated version, i.e. where we only use non-zero singular values, we can use it to find good solutions to @eq-leastsquare.

## Condition number

The condition number of a matrix provides a measure how sensitive the solution of @eq-leq is to perturbations in $A$ and $b$.
For a square matrix $A$ the condition number is defined as
$$
\kappa(A) = \|A\| \left\|A^{-1}\right\|,
$$
for an appropriate underlying norm.
For the 2-norm $\kappa_2$ is

\kappa_2(A) = \|A\|_2 \left\|A^{-1}\right\|_2 = \frac{\sigma_{max}}{\sigma_{min}}.
$$

To get a better idea on what this means think of it in this way.
For the perturbed linear system
$$
A(x + \epsilon_x) = b + \epsilon_b,
$$
we can outline the worst case, where $\epsilon_x$ aligns with the singular vector of the largest singular vector and $x$ with the smallest singular value, i.e.
$$
A(x + \epsilon_x) = \sigma_{min}x + \sigma_{max}\epsilon_x.
$$
Consequently, the output signal-to-noise $\|b\|/\epsilon_b$ is equivalent with the input signal-to-noise $\|x\|/\epsilon_x$ and the factor between those two is $\kappa_2(A)$.

In this sense $\kappa_2$ can be extended for more general matrices.

### Linear regression with SVD

Before we go into more details about regression in the next section we give a brief outlook in terms of how to solve such a problem with SVD.

#### Linear Regression [see @Brunton2022, pp. 19-21]

First we just take a linear correlation that we augment with some Gaußian Noise.
So our matrix $A$ is simple a vector with our $x$-coordinates and $b$ is the augmented image under our linear correlation.
$$
\left[
    \begin{array}{c} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{array}
\right]x = 
\left[
    \begin{array}{c} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ \vdots \\ b_n \end{array}
\right]
\quad
\Leftrightarrow
\quad
U\Sigma V^{\mathsf{T}} x = b
\quad
\Leftrightarrow
\quad
x = A^\dagger b
$$



For this example $\Sigma = \|a\|_2$, $V=1$, and $U=\tfrac{a}{\|a\|_2^2}$.
This is basically just the projection of $b$ along our basis $a$ and this is
$$
x = \frac{a^{\mathsf{T}} b}{a^{\mathsf{T}} a}.
$$

```{python}
#| label: fig-linear_regression_svd
#| fig-cap: "Linear regression with SVD."
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code for the figure"
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import numpy.linalg as LA
%config InlineBackend.figure_formats = ['svg']
np.random.seed(6020)       # Make sure to stay reproducible

k = 3
A = np.arange(-2, 2, 0.25).reshape(-1, 1)
b = k*A + np.random.randn(*A.shape) * 0.5

U, s, VT = LA.svd(A, full_matrices=False)

x = VT.T @ np.diag(1/s) @ U.T @ b

plt.plot(A, k*A, color="k", label="Target")
plt.plot(A, b, 'x', color="r", label="Noisy data")
plt.plot(A, A*x, '--', color="b", label="Regression line")
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel("$a$")
plt.ylabel("$b$")
plt.show()
```

Our reconstructed unknown $x=$ `{python} float(np.round(x, 3))` and is a reasonable good match for $k=$ `{python} float(np.round(k, 3))`

#### Multi-Linear Regression [see @Brunton2022, pp. 21-23]

The second example is based on the _Portland Cement Data_ build in with MATLAB.
In Python we again use the dataset provided on [GitHub](https://github.com/frankhuettner/Data_Driven_Science_Julia_Demos/tree/main).
The data set contains the heat generation during the hardening of 12 cement mixtures comprised of 4 basic ingredients, i.e. $A\in \mathbb{R}^{13\times 4}$.
The aim is to determine the weights $x$ that relate the proportion of the ingredients to the heat generation in the mixture.

```{python}
#| label: fig-cement_svd
#| fig-cap: "Estimate for hardening in cement mixtures."
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code for the figure"
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import numpy.linalg as LA
import requests
import io
%config InlineBackend.figure_formats = ['svg']

# Transform the content of the file into a numpy.ndarray
response = requests.get(
    "https://github.com/frankhuettner/Data_Driven_Science_Julia_Demos"
    "/raw/refs/heads/main/DATA/hald_ingredients.csv")
# Transform the content of the file into a numpy.ndarray
A = np.genfromtxt(io.BytesIO(response.content), delimiter=",")

response = requests.get(
    "https://github.com/frankhuettner/Data_Driven_Science_Julia_Demos"
    "/raw/refs/heads/main/DATA/hald_heat.csv")
b = np.genfromtxt(io.BytesIO(response.content), delimiter=",")

U, s, VT = LA.svd(A, full_matrices=False)

x = VT.T @ np.diag(1/s) @ U.T @ b

plt.plot(b, color="k", label="Target - Heat data")
plt.plot(A@x, '--', color="b", label="Regression")
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel("mixture")
plt.ylabel("Heat[cal/g]")
plt.show()
```
This concludes our investigation of matrix decompositions, we will investigate further decompositions of signals later, but for now we dive deeper into regression.
