# Regression analysis {.unnumbered}

In general, _regression analysis_ can be understood as a set of tools that is used to estimate or establish a relationship between a dependent variable $Y$ (also called outcome or response variable, label) and the independent variable $X$ (also called regressor, predictors, covariates, explanatory variable or feature).
If we add a regression function $f$ and some unknown parameters $c$ to the mix the problem can be written mathematically as
$$
Y = f(X, c)
$$ {#eq-curvefitting}
where $c$ is found by optimizing for _a good fit_ of $f$ to the data.

We split up the discussion along the well known topics:

- @sec-regression-linear
- @sec-regression-nonlinear
   - @sec-regression-nonlinear-gd
- @sec-regression-optimizers
   - @sec-regression-optimizers-msou
