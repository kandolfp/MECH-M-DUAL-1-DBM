# Regression analysis {.unnumbered}

In general, _regression analysis_ can be understood as a set of tools that is used to estimate or establish a relationship between a dependent variable $Y$ (also called outcome or response variable, label) and the independent variable $X$ (also called regressor, predictors, covariates, explanatory variable or feature).
If we add a regression function $f$ and some unknown parameters $\beta$ to the mix the problem can be written mathematically as
$$
Y = f(X, \beta)
$$ {#qe-curvefitting}
where $\beta$ is found by optimizing for _a good fit_ of $f$ to the data.

We split up the discussion along the well known topics:

- [linear regression](linear.qmd)
- non-linear regression
- multilinear regression
- gradient decent
- over and under fitting

Parts of this section are based on [@Brunton2022, Section 4].
