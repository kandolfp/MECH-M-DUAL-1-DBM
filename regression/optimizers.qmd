# Optimizers {#sec-regression-optimizers}

As we have seen in the previous section the task of regression usually results in an optimization problem.
It is worth investigating this further by looking closely on the 
$$
A x = b
$$ {#eq-axb}
problem for different dimensions of $A$.

We investigate the impact of restricting our solution not just by @eq-axb but with the help of the $l_1$ and $l_2$ norm imposed on the solution $x$.
As we have seen in @fig-linear_reg the choice of norm has an implication on the result and the same is true here.
