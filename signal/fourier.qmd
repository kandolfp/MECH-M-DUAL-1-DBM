# Fourier transform {#sec-signal-fourier}

The fourier transform helps us convert a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain.
In this section our main concern is going to be one dimensional signals, but the concepts can be applied to multiple dimensions.

Before we can start defining the _Fourier Series_ we need to extend our notion of vector space to functions.
This is done with _Hilbert_ spaces.

## Hilbert inner product
The _Hilbert inner product_ of two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ is defined for $x \in [a, b]$ as:
$$
\langle f(x), g(x)\rangle = \int_a^b f(x) \overline{g}(x)\, \mathrm{d}x,
$$
where $\overline{g}(x)$ denotes the complex conjugate.

At first this looks strange but it is closely related to our already known @def-dotproduct.

As a first step, if we move from real to complex vector spaces the transpose is replaced by the conjugate transposed or hermit transpose, in notation the $^\mathbf{T}$ becomes $^\mathbf{H}$.

Now consider a discrete version of $f$ and $g$ at regular intervals $\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n-1}$ where 
$$
f_i = f(x_i) = f(a + (i - 1) \Delta x),\quad i = 1, \ldots n,
$$
same for $g_i$ and accordingly $x_1 = a + 0 \Delta x = a$ and $x_n = a + (n - 1)\Delta x = b$.

The inner product is than
$$
\langle f, g \rangle = \langle\left[\begin{array}{c}f_1 \\ f_2 \\ \vdots \\ f_n \end{array}\right], \left[\begin{array}{c}g_1 \\ g_2 \\ \vdots \\ g_n \end{array}\right] \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^n f_i \overline{g}_i = \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i)\overline{g}(x_i).
$$

As this sum will increase by increasing $n$ we should normalize it by the factor $\Delta x$.

$$
\frac{b-a}{n-1} \langle g, f \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i)\overline{g}(x_i) \Delta x.
$$
If we now increase $n\to \infty$ we get $\Delta x \to 0$ and the sum transforms into the integral.

## Hilbert two norm
The _Hilbert two norm_ of the function $f(x)$ is defined for $x \in [a, b]$ as:
$$
\|f\|_2 = \sqrt{\langle f(x), g(x)\rangle} = \left(\int_a^b f(x) \overline{f}(x)\,\mathrm{d}x\right)^{\frac12},
$$
where $\overline{f}(x)$ denotes the complex conjugate. 

The set of all functions with bounded norm defines the Hilbert space $L^2(a, b)$, i.e. the set of all square integrable functions.
This space is also called the space of _Lebesgue_ integrable functions.

Similar as we saw projection in vector spaces related to the inner product this is true here as well. 

The Fourier series is nothing else as the projection of a function with an integer period on the domain $[a, b]$ onto the orthogonal basis defined by the sine and cosine functions.
