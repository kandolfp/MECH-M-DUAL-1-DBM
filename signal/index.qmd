# Signal Processing {.unnumbered}

In previous parts we have already discussed how changing a coordinate system or basis (@def-changebasis) can simplify expression or computation, see @sec-matrixdc-eigen and @sec-matrixdc-svd, among others.

One of the most fundamental coordinate transformations was introduced by J.-B. Joseph Fourier in the early 1800s.
While investigating _heat_ he discovered that sine and cosine functions with increasing frequency form an orthogonal basis (@def-basis & @def-orthonormal).
In fact, the sine and cosine functions for an eigenbasis for the heat equation
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \Delta u
$$
and solving it becomes trivial once you determine the corresponding eigenvalues that are connected to the geometry, amplitudes, and boundary conditions.

In the 200+ years since, this discovery has not only founded new corners of mathematics but also allows via the _fast fourier transform_ or FFT the real-time image and audio compression that make our global communication networks work.

In the same area the related wavelets where developed to for advanced signal processing and compression.

In this section we are going to discuss basics of signal processing in terms of these and other signal transformations, see

- @sec-signal-fourier
- @sec-signal-wavelet
- @sec-signal-2d

Parts of this section are based on [@Brunton2022, Chapter 2].
