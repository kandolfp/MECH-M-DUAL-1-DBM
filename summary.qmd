# Summary {.unnumbered}

This concludes our introduction to the basis of data science with a focus on engineering topics.

These notes introduced the main concepts with a clear focus on accurate mathematical representation and close illustration with programmatic examples.

If we need to sum up the main concept that is present in large sections of these notes it is that the correct representation is key in finding good concepts of computer based processing.
To this extent, the second key concept is to ensure that the concepts are manageable both by a computer and by the student, so that theory and programmatic application go hand in hand.
Both concepts stay true if we move to more evolved data science methods in further classes.
